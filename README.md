# LLM-Powered Digital Twin for Physical AI  
### Multi-Agent • Spatial • Interactive

## Overview

This project implements a **research-grade Digital Twin for Physical AI systems** that integrates:

- Static IoT sensors  
- Mobile robots  
- Autonomous drones  
- Smartglasses (AR & Human-in-the-loop)
- Spatial 3D perception  
- LLM-based reasoning and explanation  

The Digital Twin maintains a **live internal representation of the physical world**, models **embodied agents**, and uses a **LangChain-powered cognitive layer** to reason about system behavior, anomalies, and next actions.

The project is developed in **phases**, evolving from telemetry-driven twins to **spatial, multi-agent Physical AI**.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1 — State-Centric Digital Twin
- IoT telemetry ingestion (MQTT)
- System Twin + Agent Twins
- Rule-based health evaluation
- Anomaly detection
- LLM reasoning with RAG

### Phase 2 — Spatial & Embodied Physical AI *(Current)*

Phase 2 upgrades the Digital Twin with **spatial intelligence and embodiment**.

New capabilities:
- Multi-agent modeling (robots + drones)
- 3D spatial environment representation
- Interactive visualization

### Architecture Layers

1. **Physical Layer**
   - IoT sensors (environment, power, vibration)
   - Mobile robots (joints, load, motor health)
   - Autonomous drones (pose, battery, perception)
   - Smartglasses (head pose, gaze, voice commands)

2. **Perception & Spatial Layer (Phase 2)**

   - Agent Twins (robots & drones)
   - Rules engine
   - Anomaly detection

5. **Cognitive Layer**
   - LangChain LLM agent
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
   - Context-aware reasoning

6. **Interaction Layer**
   - FastAPI
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Natural language interface
   - Interactive 3D viewer

## Digital Twin Model

### System Twin
Represents:
- Global environment state
- Infrastructure health
- Spatial zones and history

### Agent Twins (Robots, Drones, & Smartglasses)

Each embodied agent is modeled as an independent **Agent Twin**:

- Pose (position & orientation)
- Velocity
- Battery / power state
- Health & fault indicators
- Active mission
- Perception context

This enables **multi-agent reasoning and coordination**, treating human operators (via Smartglasses) as active agents in the system.

---

## Spatial Digital Twin (Phase 2)

Phase 2 introduces a **spatial representation layer** powered by
**Gaussian Splatting**:

- Drones and robots capture RGB images and pose
- 3D environment is reconstructed and updated
- Spatial changes are detected and converted into structured events
- The Digital Twin reasons over *spatial facts*, not raw pixels

The LLM never consumes images directly — it reasons over **interpretable spatial state**.

---

## Example Questions the System Can Answer

- *Why did drone alpha abort its inspection mission?*
- *Is robot beta safe to continue operation under current load?*
- *Which agent should inspect the detected structural change?*
- *What is the operator looking at right now?*
- *What changed in the environment since yesterday?*

## Why This Matters

Most monitoring systems report metrics.

This project demonstrates how to build **thinking physical systems** by:
- Modeling embodied agents
- Grounding AI in real spatial context
- Separating perception, state, and cognition
- Using LLMs for explanation and decision support — not control

It represents a practical step toward **Physical AI and intelligent cyber-physical systems**.

## Future Phases

Planned directions:
- Autonomous mission planning
- Multi-agent task allocation
- Simulation ↔ real-world synchronization
- Learned world models
- Closed-loop autonomy experiments
